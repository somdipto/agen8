# Agent Instructions

When working on this project, always follow these steps before completing your work:

## 1. Format Code
```bash
pnpm format
```
This will format all TypeScript and TSX files using Prettier with Tailwind CSS class sorting.

## 2. Type Check
```bash
pnpm type-check
```
Run TypeScript compiler to check for type errors. Fix any type errors that appear.

## 3. Lint
```bash
pnpm lint
```
Check for linting errors using ESLint. Fix any linting issues.

## 4. Fix Issues
If any of the above commands fail or show errors:
- Read the error messages carefully
- Fix the issues in the relevant files
- Re-run the commands to verify fixes
- Repeat until all checks pass

## Important Notes
- Never commit code with type errors or linting issues
- Format code before making commits
- All three checks must pass before work is considered complete
